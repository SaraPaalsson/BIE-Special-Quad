Initialization
=================
To initialize our computations, the computational domain will be set up and parametrized. This setup needs to be done once for each test case and is then saved in **indata/filename**.  


Needed packages for these computations are: 

* `JLD <https://github.com/JuliaLang/JLD.jl>`_
